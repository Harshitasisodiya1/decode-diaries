// ### ðŸŒ¼ **Story 1: The Gardener's Daily Work**

// **Story:**

// In a peaceful village, a kind gardener plants flowers every day. She follows some special rules that her grandmother gave her. She writes in her notebook what she plants from Day 1 to Day N.

// **Your Work:**

// Help her find how many flowers she planted by following these rules.

// **Hints:**

// - If the day number is divisible by 2 â†’ plant 2 Sunbuds.
// - If divisible by 3 â†’ plant 3 Moonblossoms.
// - If divisible by 4 â†’ plant 4 Starroots.
// - If divisible by both 2 and 3 â†’ plant 1 Crystal Flower.
// - If divisible by 2, 3, and 4 â†’ no flower (soil is resting).
// - If none of these â†’ plant 1 Wildleaf.

// **Tasks:**

// - Count how many of each flower she planted.
// - Find how many days soil was resting.
// - Find total number of flowers.
